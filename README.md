# PyBank

![Revenue](Images/revenue-per-lead.png)

In this challenge I wrote python script to analyze a large csv of financial data. My script parses the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

Last, my script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

# PyPoll

![Vote-Counting](Images/Vote_counting.png)

In this challenge, my goal was to modernize a rural town's vote-counting process. I was given a set of poll data, and wrote a python script that parsed the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

As before, my script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
